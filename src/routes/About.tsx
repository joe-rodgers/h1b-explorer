      <p>H1B Explorer was created out of a simple but urgent question: <em>what is really happening with immigration in America?</em></p>


<p>The U.S. immigration system is complicated, and the H‑1B program sits right at the center of it. Every year, tens of thousands of applications move through government channels, but the raw numbers are buried in spreadsheets and PDFs that most people never see.</p>


<p>This project is my attempt to change that. By taking the official data released by USCIS and turning it into interactive charts, maps, and tables, H1B Explorer makes it easier to see the trends:</p>


<ul>
<li>Which companies are filing the most petitions</li>
<li>Where the jobs are located</li>
<li>How approval and denial rates shift over time</li>
<li>Which sectors rely most heavily on the H‑1B program</li>
</ul>


<p>This is just the beginning. The goal is not only to build better tools for understanding the H‑1B program but also to start pulling back the curtain on how immigration policy actually shapes the American workforce.</p>


<p>If you have ever wondered <em>who gets to come here, who decides, and why</em>, H1B Explorer is built for you.</p>
